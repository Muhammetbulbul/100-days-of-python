# 🧠 Day 04 - Randomization and Lists

This project explores the fundamentals of Python's `random` module and how to create, access, and manipulate lists effectively.

You’ll learn how to generate random numbers, make random selections, and use lists to store and manage multiple data items. By combining these concepts, you'll be able to build fun and interactive mini-projects.

## 🔍 Topics Covered:
- Using `random.randint()` to generate random integers
- Selecting random elements with `random.choice()`
- Creating and accessing list elements using indexing
- Updating, appending, and removing items from a list
- Looping through lists with `for` and `while`
- Combining randomness and lists to build simple games

## 🕹️ Mini Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
You'll build a console-based version of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, where the user competes against the computer. The computer's move is selected at random, and the winner is decided based on game rules.

This project is a great introduction to game logic, control flow, and user interaction in Python.
